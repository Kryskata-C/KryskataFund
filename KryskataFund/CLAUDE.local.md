# Local Project Preferences

## Commit Strategy
- Make very small, granular commits to maximize commit count
- Commit after creating a new file (even before adding content)
- Commit after each small edit or addition
- Keep each commit focused on the smallest possible change
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any AI attribution to commit messages
